## Introduction 
Pets are playing a large role in our lives as a partner or a friend, these exotic pets, however, have to be treated differently as they are different than a usual pet such as dogs or cats. An exotic pet is a rare or unusual animal pet: an animal kept within human households which is relatively unusual to keep or is generally thought of as a wild species rather than as a pet. However, to Bangkokbiznew, there is a 10% increase in pet breeding. Especially, the number of exotic pets tend to rise every year. Nowadays, unusual animals such as hedgehogs, pigeons, and even tiger cubs are becoming increasingly popular in the modern pet trade as exotic pets. These exotic animals can be purchased online from breeders, specialty websites, and classified ad sites like craigslist; however, the credibility of many online shops are known for their bad reputations about many risks and legal considerations. Therefore, our team desires to create an online pet trading platform that covers most of the exotic species that many people are interested in having them as a unique pet without having to worry about illegal trading rights or infection risk. Here we aim to provide special services for all of our target customers which we have differentiated them into 2 categories which are those who are interested in having a unique pet and another target who is the owner of the exotic farm. 
<br>
As we understand our customer’s pain and need of how difficult it is when it comes to purchasing high-quality exotic animals as there are not many options in the market and the conditions of the animal are not guaranteed to be safe, we came up with many solutions and create a channel to connect our customers with the high-quality verified farm which is the beginning of our platform that can be portrayed as an ethical marketplace called Petiverse. Petiverse is an online luxury exotic pet trading platform that covers most kinds of exotic species, exotic pets, pet products. Here we dedicated to consistently providing high customer satisfaction by rendering excellent service and satisfy the desire of our customers by selling the exotic pets that are guaranteed to have a perfect health condition by being a platform that allows clients who are interested in purchasing an exotic pet to connect with exotic pets farms that specialized in specific types of exotic pets. In addition, the platform in our platform is differentiated from most of the shops in Chatuchak or general farms by the quality, diversity, convenience, reliability, and prices. We also differentiate our platform from the others as we also have a connection with Mahidol professional veterinarians as our partner as they verified all the farm listed on our website and they also write articles about many things that are related to exotic animals which can be useful for our platform users. With Petiverse, our customers satisfaction is guaranteed while using our platform and decide to purchase all kinds of products with us as we have good after-service policies since we care about our customer’s satisfaction.

Therefore, view the product, order the product and make payment will come first. Then, the 2nd priority is the requirement that is not about e-commerce but still important. For example,  reporting the problem or contacting farms via live chat are important. For the last priority, These requirements are optional.

## Data Flow Diagram Level 0 - Context Diagram

![Petiverse's Data Flow Diagram Level 0](/phase-1/Petiverse-DFD.jpg "Petiverse's Data Flow Diagram Level 0")

### Description:
Firstly, we start with “customer” at the light blue line. They must do a registration for providing registration information into the system. Also some actors  which are veterinarian, customer service and farm have to log in for recording login information to the system.

The black line shows that whenever the customer adjusts their profile it will be kept into the system.
Next, the purple line farm will upload farm description and product details to be shown on the system interface for the customer to view the product, then another red line the customer will send the product ordering into the system which will be provided to the farm.

Beside that the gray line farm can send the updating stock in product details anytime.

Since our system is not responsible for product delivery the farm will report the delivery status on the systems instead which can also be seen by the customer.

The pink one is contacting the farm so we will keep this information to the system for the farm to check.
The next step is the light green light after the customer does the payment, the payment information will be kept and sent to the farm as a customer payment approval, beside that the bank has to do a verification to keep credit verification into a system.

Moreover, the system received the veterinarian articles for customers to educate themselves , then customers can submit Veterinarian and article ratings back to veterinarians to be seen at the yellow line.

After that, in the case there is on problem, the customer will do the rating submission on the system which will also send to the farm, but if there is some reporting problem from the customer, the system will send this information to the customer service. 

Once the customer receives the service that means the problems are already solved, customer service will send a solved problem confirmation to the system.
